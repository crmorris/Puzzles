Puzzle 1: Can I Create a Tool to Find Words in a Word Search Puzzle?
As of 10/16/2021, this tool adds indices for the x and y-coordinates where you can find a word if the string you're searching for is in order in the puzzle.
Future Plans:
1 - Add logic so that it will be able to look forward, backward, and diagonally.
2 - Add logic to allow it to import a CSV file with the letters instead of having to type in the information.
3 - (maybe) If possible, add in logic, so it can do it with a picture of a crossword puzzle.
